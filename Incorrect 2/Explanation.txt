Vulnerability: Open Redirect Attacks
Incorrect 2. 
An encrypted url is passed in the parameters.
HomeController.cs: 31-41. Method TestRedirect. The url is decrypted. Redirect to this url is called.
_Layout.cshtml: 31-32. Menu item added to menu. The parameter-url is registered in the menu item. The parameter-url is encrypted.
TestRedirect.cshtml. Gets the url. When you click on the button, you should be redirected.

Disadvantage: Vulnerability remains. If encryption is simple, then it is possible to crack it and replace the url.
