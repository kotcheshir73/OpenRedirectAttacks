An encrypted url is passed in the parameters.
HomeController.cs: 31-41. Method TestRedirect. The url is decrypted. Redirect to this url is called.
_Layout.cshtml: 31-32. Menu item added to menu. The parameter-url is registered in the menu item. The parameter-url is encrypted.
TestRedirect.cshtml. Gets the url. When you click on the button, you should be redirected.

Disadvantage: Vulnerability remains. Using routes/links encoded as Base64 strings would only provide the illusion of security. An attacker can simply encode their own custom link to Base64 and pass it as a query parameter which could then be used for phishing scams as the link would look legitimate.
