Vulnerability: Open Redirect Attacks.
	Substitution of a line for another line. The goal is to redirect to a fake address.
Example. 
	Get-Request /Home/TestRedirect. Parameter - url.
	HomeController.cs: 31-39. Method TestRedirect. The url is passed in the parameters. Redirect to this url is called.
	_Layout.cshtml: 31. Menu item added to menu. The parameter-url is registered in the menu item.
	TestRedirect.cshtml. Gets the url. When you click on the button, you should be redirected.

Secure
Good diff.
	The standard method (IsLocalUrl) is used to verify that the address is local. Recommended to fix this vulnerability.
	HomeController.cs: 31-44. Method TestRedirect. Verification of the address. If the address is not local, then redirects to the home page. Redirect to this url is called.
	_Layout.cshtml: 31. Menu item added to menu. The parameter-url is registered in the menu item.
	TestRedirect.cshtml. Gets the url. When you click on the button, you should be redirected.
	
Incorrect 0. 
	Change get-request to post-request.
	Disadvantage: the request can also be substituted.
	HomeController.cs: 31-45. Method TestRedirect. The url is passed in the parameters. Url checked for equality to empty string. If the url is equal to the empty string, then redirect to the home page. Redirect to this url is called.
	_Layout.cshtml: 31, 44-57. Menu item added to menu. Adding a script to call a post-request. The parameter-url is registered in the script.
	TestRedirect.cshtml. Gets the url. When you click on the button, you should be redirected.

Incorrect 1. 
	Adding a url check to the pattern.
	Disadvantage: The difficulty of working with templates. It does not guarantee 100% protection. May not miss the correct address.
	HomeController.cs: 32-45. Method TestRedirect. The url is passed in the parameters. Url checked for equality to empty string or not equal to the pattern. If the url is equal to the empty string or not equal to the pattern, then redirect to the home page. Redirect to this url is called.
	_Layout.cshtml: 31. Menu item added to menu. The parameter-url is registered in the menu item.
	TestRedirect.cshtml. Gets the url. When you click on the button, you should be redirected.

Incorrect 2. 
	An encrypted url is passed in the parameters.
	Disadvantage: Vulnerability remains. Using routes/links encoded as Base64 strings would only provide the illusion of security. An attacker can simply encode their own custom link to Base64 and pass it as a query parameter which could then be used for phishing scams as the link would look legitimate.
	HomeController.cs: 31-41. Method TestRedirect. The url is decrypted. Redirect to this url is called.
	_Layout.cshtml: 31-32. Menu item added to menu. The parameter-url is registered in the menu item. The parameter-url is encrypted.
	TestRedirect.cshtml. Gets the url. When you click on the button, you should be redirected.
