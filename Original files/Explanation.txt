Vulnerability: Open Redirect Attacks.
Substitution of a line for another line. The goal is to redirect to a fake address.
Example. 
Get-Request /Home/TestRedirect. Parameter - url.
HomeController.cs: 31-39. Method TestRedirect. The url is passed in the parameters. Redirect to this url is called.
_Layout.cshtml: 31. Menu item added to menu. The parameter-url is registered in the menu item.
TestRedirect.cshtml. Gets the url. When you click on the button, you should be redirected.

Open the application in the Visual Studio (version 2017 or higher). Run it. In the menu, select "TestRedirect". Click the "Redirect" for check.
