Vulnerability: Open Redirect Attacks.
Substitution of a line for another line. The goal is to redirect to a fake address.
Example. 
Get-Request /Home/TestRedirect. Parameter - url.
HomeController.cs: 31-39. Method TestRedirect. The url is passed in the parameters. Redirect to this url is called.
_Layout.cshtml: 31. Menu item added to menu. The parameter-url is registered in the menu item.
TestRedirect.cshtml. Gets the url. When you click on the button, you should be redirected.
